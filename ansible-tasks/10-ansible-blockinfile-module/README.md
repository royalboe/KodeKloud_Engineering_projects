# Ansible Blockinfile Module

## Description

The Nautilus DevOps team wants to install and set up a simple httpd web server on all app servers in Stratos DC. Additionally, they want to deploy a sample web page for now using Ansible only. Therefore, write the required playbook to complete this task. Find more details about the task below.

### Instructions

We already have an inventory file under /home/thor/ansible directory on jump host. Create a playbook.yml under /home/thor/ansible directory on jump host itself.

* Using the playbook, install httpd web server on all app servers. Additionally, make sure its service should up and running.
* Using blockinfile Ansible module add some content in /var/www/html/index.html file. Below is the content:

```txt
Welcome to XfusionCorp!

This is  Nautilus sample file, created using Ansible!

Please do not modify this file manually!
```

* The /var/www/html/index.html file's user and group owner should be apache on all app servers.
* The /var/www/html/index.html file's permissions should be 0655 on all app servers.

Note:

i. Validation will try to run the playbook using command ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml so please make sure the playbook works this way without passing any extra arguments.
ii. Do not use any custom or empty marker for blockinfile module.
